# Connect Four - ENGGEN 131
This is a project in The University of Auckland's Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree in course named 'ENGGEN 131: Introduction to Engineering Computation and Software Development'. It is a customized 'Connect Four' game played in the console.

> ### How it works:

The player selects the option to play a game, with either another player or a bot (he could also play a bot vs bot game).

The board below is of size 10. There are four sides where you can place the counter, North N, West W, East E and South S. When placed in a side, the counter slides in the direction of the placement until the counter hits either a boundary or another counter.

There is a block of boundary blocks in the middle of the block. From board size 5 to 10, there are boundary blocks (with the appropriate number of blocks) in the middle.

> ### Screenshots:

##### Turn 0:
* The board size is 8.
* The mode is Player vs. Player.
